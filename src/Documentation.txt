Component : -- Drawer :- props used( overlay)
Audio 

q-gutter-y-md

carousel prop ( infinite )

library used for animation is @vueuse/motion

scrolling to sepecific loaction we use scrollInToView method 
const headerHeight = 200; // Adjust this to the actual height of your header
        const scrollPosition = element.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY - headerHeight;
        window.scrollTo({
          top: scrollPosition,
          behavior: 'smooth',
        })


@hide is a prop of Drawer which we use to close drawer and pass to specific section so when drawer is getting closed we are calling the function 
which emits our sectionId so we need to pass a reference variable to store the value of section and then pass it

@hide will only and only call a function when the DrawerOpen is made to false

to send an audio file from parent component to child component as a prop we need to import and then we need to pass a reference variable with the value of imported
